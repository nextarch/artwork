# NextArch Logos
In this repo, we have artwork in standard formats for the NextArch projects and programs. We prepare artwork in 2 formats (PNG & SVG), 3 layouts -- horizontal (also known as landscape format), stacked (which is closer to square), and icon (which does not include the name and is square), and at least 3 versions (color/black/white). So, that's at least 18 versions of most logos.

With many browsers, you can right click and copy the logo of your choice below. Please note that although PNG is more common, SVG file sizes are smaller, supported in all modern web browsers, and a high-resolution format suitable for both print and high-resolution computer screens.
